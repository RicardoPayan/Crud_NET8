# .NET8 MVC CRUD Project

This project aims to learn about web application development using .NET 8, MVC (Model-View-Controller), and the Code First approach with Entity Framework.

## Project Description

In this repository, we are developing a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using .NET 8 and MVC. The CRUD operations will be implemented using Entity Framework, an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that allows us to work with relational databases using domain objects from our code.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET 8:** Software development platform for building high-quality applications.
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** Software architecture pattern that separates the representation of information from the way it is presented to the user.
- **Entity Framework:** ORM framework that enables working with data in databases using domain-specific objects.
- **Code First:** Approach where we design our domain classes in code and Entity Framework creates the database based on these classes.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Models:** Contains domain classes representing entities in our application.
- **Controllers:** Handle HTTP requests and control the flow of the application.
- **Views:** Define the user interface of our application.
- **Migrations:** Database migrations automatically generated by Entity Framework.
